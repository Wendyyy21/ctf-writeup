## Description:
This is a disaster solve it

## Solution:
1. We are given a png file. When I run `file` to identify the file type, it says "data". This is strange since the file is obviously an image, which hints that the fileâ€™s magic number may be corrupted. 
2. Search online for the magic number of a png file, and use `hexeditor` to fix the corrupted bytes. 
3. Open the fixed image file to get the flag.
