## Description:
Bro, I found "Among Us" at this school!

Can you spot the hidden acronym?
Wrap it in v1t{...} to submit your answer.

Example: University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City => v1t{UEH}

## Solution:
1. We are given an image of a university.

2. A quick search with Google Lens tells us that it is the University of Information Technology (UIT) in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. So the acronym would be UIT.

## Flag:
v1t{UIT}
