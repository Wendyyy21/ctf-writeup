## Description:
We received an encrypted message. The modulus is built from primes large enough that factoring them isnâ€™t an option, at least not today. See if you can make sense of the numbers and reveal the flag.

## Solution:
1. We are given n, e and c. We need to calculate m (plaintext). Given that e is relatively small, we can use the Coppersmith Attack to calculate m. Use this python script to calculate m and convert the integer into text:
