## Description:
Control Message Protocol

## Solution:
1. We are given a pcap file with multiple ICMP packets. There isnâ€™t any interesting information in the packets themselves, since they are all identical. The only thing different is the time, which are decimal integers.
2. I tried converting the first few integers to ASCII, but only the first non-zero integer (83) could be converted; the rest were out of range.
3. Interestingly, 83 becomes S, which is the correct format for our flag; so I tried taking the difference between two consecutive integers (83-0=83, 167-83=84, ...) and converting that to ASCII. With that, I got the flag.
